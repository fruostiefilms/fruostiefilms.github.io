            <h2>Production</h2>
            <p>The film "Finch" began production on the 2/03/2024, this film was produced and directed by Connor Hannaford the chief visualisation officer at Fruostie Films. This film is the pilot for Fruostie Films and thus they put the most effort into it, "We would stay up editing all night." quoted Bodhi Reimer. They gave themselves a tight deadline of May 2024, which was only 2 months from the begining of writing and filming meaning they needed to get it done quick.</p>

            <h2>Release (Prediction)</h2>
            <p>After the tireless filming and production of "Finch" it released exactly on May 3rd 2024, the main idea was to spread awareness about how the Gouldian Finch is an endangered species that needs to be protected. When the film first released it was a major flop but it eventually became a chart topper Documentary, that was seen by millions around the globe.</p>
