            <h2>Galactic History</h2>
            <p>During the 21st century a war between [UNIDENTIFYED] and the United States of America broke out resulting in hundreds of thousands of military and civilian deaths, this war made multiple nuteral countries war zones. Eventually [UNIDENTIFYED] launched nuclear bombs on several major cities, causing massive amounts of distruction even making Japan and Bangladesh completely inhabitable. This made the USA and its allies launch multiple nuclear balistic missiles at [UNIDENTIFYED]. Eventually the world broke out into full nuclear war with nearly every country being entirely decimated. In the year 2783 the global war was still raging on, when a massive asteriod rambed into earth killing more than half the population with the rest escaping into space transports, heading to other planets.</p>

            <h2>UESF Military</h2>
            <h4>Ranking System</h4>
            <p>The UESF has a very complicated ranking system, as it uses many historical ranks as well as many 20th century ranks with some custom ranks included. We start with the lowest rank "Recruit" the recruit is a marine that has just been trained and sent out to battle. After their first battle a recruit will join the ranks of ensign/private (these terms will be used interchangeably) the ensign is the "Lowest" trooper rank, troopers with this rank are considered "standard issue", after ensign there is "Lance Corporal" this rank just serves as a buffer so marines can hold some form of authority over other troopers. "Master Deck Officers" serve only as troopers that make the shipment schedules and flight paths. Now we have "Corporal" the rank that works with sergeants to lead squads. "Petty Officer" all the 'Petty Officer' ranks are basically the same and they all serve the purpose of operating star fleets, next we have "Sergeant/Sergeant Major" both ranks are used to lead squads. "Lieutenant" are platoon leaders they are just below the rank of commander, now we have "Commander" and al its variants that all serve the same purpose of leading companies of 152 troopers. "Captain" is a very important as they lead entire battalions of 512 troopers, "Major" the rank of major is held by very elite troopers, and they lead brigades of 2,048 troopers. "Commodore" is a high rank that leads entire corps of 8,192 troopers. The final proper rank is "Commandant" 2 of these lead sector armies of 32,768 troopers.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>After the proper ranks we have our high command ranks, our first high command rank is "Colonel" these ranks can lead entire sector armies on their own. Then we have "Marshal/Fleet Marshal" these ranks are the exact same as Colonel just they have a high rank, now we have our "Admiral" ranks which lead entire theatre of the galaxy. "Consul" is useless other than for the Supreme General to control more things. Second to last is all the "General" ranks which command the special forces units of the UESF. Finally, we have the "Supreme General" this is the highest of every rank and it leads the entire UESF military of over 131,072 troopers. The only person to outrank the "Supreme General" is the "High Supreme General" and they rule the whole of the UESF.</p>
            <h4>Deployment Types</h4>
            <p>First you have a "Squad" they are made up of 1 Master Chief Petty Officer, 1 Corporal and 6 Ensigns, next we have "Platoon" which is 4x the number of troopers in a squad and adds a Sergeant/Sergeant Major, then we have "Company" which is made of 4 Platoons and an added Lieutenant. Next, we have a "Battalion" made of 4 companies with an added Captain and 2 Commanders, after this we have "Brigade" which hold 4 Battalions to a total of 2,048 troopers with an added Major, now we have "Corp" which holds 4 brigades to a total of 8,192 troopers with an added commodore. Next, we have "Sector Army" which has 4 Corps to a total of 32,768 troopers with 2 added commandants, finally we have the whole military which holds 4 Sector Amies to a total of 131,072 troopers with added High Command.</p>
            <h4>Trooper Types</h4>
            <p>The UESF military has many types of troopers, the basic trooper is called a "Marine" then you have the "Ranger" which is the more advanced Marine, next you have "Airborne Trooper" which are also called para-troopers and they use jet-packs to form an arial assault. Then you have "Enforcers" these troopers are equipped with better weaponry and training, now you have "Armoured Assault Trooper" which use the heavy armoured vehicles. The you have "Spec-Ops Trooper" these troopers are trained in close quarters fighting and assassination, next are the "Shock Trooper" these troopers are trained from children they are physically enhanced and are equipped with advanced suits of armour called "Storm Armour". Finally you have the best of the Shock Troopers the "Guards Men" these are specially trained Shock Troopers equipped with better gear. You also have the "Vehicle Technicians" that are trained to repair damaged armoured vehicles.</p>
