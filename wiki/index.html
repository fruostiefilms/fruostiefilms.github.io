            <h2>Histoy of Fruostie Films</h2>
            <h3>|| Chapter 1: Beginning ||</h3>
            <p>
        Fruostie Films was founded on the 24th of Febuary 2024, its started as only 2 friends wanting to make some cool short films but it soon became apparent that Fruostie Films could be much more then that. They started building a team of their friends, forming a full team of executives within the first 2 weeks of the studio starting. The founder of Fruostie Films originaly wanted to make a small project where he could enjoy film making, although this soon was wiped out when he decided to make this a more serious project. 
        They began writing books, films and other forms of media that they could publish to make just a bit of money to start fully producing decent quality films.

            <h3>|| Chapter 2: Present Day ||</h3>
            <p>
        Fruostie Films current major project "Finch" is a documentary that follows the life of a gouldian finch. This project is to be produced and directed by Connor Hannaford the chief visualisation officer at Fruostie Films, the trailer at this point has not yet been released yet it is planned to be the flagship production of the studio. 
        With many films and productions planned, Fruostie Films is showing its spark of passion that we don't see in many studios nowadays. A leak from the Fruostie Films production team has showed the dedication that these passionate film makers have, with the small team of film crew dedicating their time and effort into producing the best documentary they can.
